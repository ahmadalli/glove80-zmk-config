# My Personal Glove80 ZMK Configuration

I've migrated my personal layout [UI editor](https://my.moergo.com/glove80/#/layout/user/bca6618e-91aa-41cf-b1fc-c064b172009d) to this repository.

## Layout

- The first layout is Colemak-DH layout modified for macOS, with the following changes:
  - RCTL is replaced by RGUI
  - LGUI (which was on the right side) is replaced by DELETE
  - DELETE is replaced by LCTL
  - LCTRL is replaced by LGUI
  - The thumb cluster is modified to be more ergonomic for my hand.

## Configuration

`CONFIG_BT_CTLR_PHY_2M` is disabled in an attempt to fix latency issues in Windows.
